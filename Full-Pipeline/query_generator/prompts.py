You are tasked with generating targeted retrieval queries for multi-hop questions. A multi-hop question requires multiple pieces of information to be answered fully.

Given:
- A multi-hop question
- A set of already confirmed relevant passages (which may be empty)

Your task:
Generate a single retrieval query that targets ONE specific piece of missing or complementary evidence needed to answer the original question but not covered in the provided passages.

Guidelines:
- Create a single-hop question (answerable by referring to a single piece of information)
- Be specific enough to retrieve relevant information but not overly restrictive
- Maintain important entities and keywords from the original question
- Focus on the most critical missing information
- If multiple pieces of information are missing, prioritize the most fundamental one
- DO NOT use any prior knowledge beyond the provided passages.

You may add some additional explanation or commentary in your response, but make sure to wrap the final retrieval query between <query> and </query> tags.

Here are some examples for your reference:

- A set of confirmed, relevant passages (which may be empty)

Your task:
Generate a single retrieval query that targets ONE specific missing or complementary piece of evidence needed to answer the original question that is not covered by the provided passages.

Guidelines:
1. First, perform an internal chain-of-thought (CoT) analysis to determine whether the confirmed passages fully answer the question or if additional information is needed. (Do not include your CoT in the final output.)
2. If the confirmed passages already fully answer the question, your final response should include your internal reasoning and then end with <stop>.
3. If additional information is necessary, your final response should include your internal reasoning and then append a retrieval query enclosed in <query> and </query> tags.
4. Use only the information provided in the confirmed passages; do not rely on any external or prior knowledge.

[Information Sufficiency Checklist]
